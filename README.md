# USAGE 

Download  [(click here)](https://nextpagetechnologies.com/react_themes/apricot_theme1) and uncompress the theme package archive in your desired folder location. 

## Installation 

Install the app dependencies by running the following command in the command line inside the folder root where you have unzipped the theme package archive.

    npm intall

After npm finishes installing the modules from package.json you can go ahead and start the application. To do so, run the command below.

You can also use yarn to install dependencies instead of npm.

    npm start
  
 After the comand finished, you should see a Compiled successfully! message in your terminal window. Also, a web server service will be   started so you can view your app in the browser: (http://localhost:3000)

## Production Build

  To create a production optimised build run the command below:
  
    npm run build
    
  This created another folder in the root of your project named build. You'll have an option to start a local web server to view your     newly created production build.
    
      serve -s build -l 4000
   
  This will start a local web server on port 4000, on which the production folder (/build/) will be available in your browser.
